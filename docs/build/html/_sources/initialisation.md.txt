# Initialisation 

Before using lasair you need to use the `init` command to generate a user settings file. Running the following creates a [yaml](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) settings file in your home folder under `~/.config/lasair/lasair.yaml`:

```bash
lasair init
```

The file is initially populated with lasair's default settings which can be adjusted to your preference.

If at any point the user settings file becomes corrupted or you just want to start afresh, simply trash the `lasair.yaml` file and rerun `lasair init`.
